C programming provides built-in support to create, read, write and append data to file. To perform any operation on file we use a built-in FILE structure. You need to create pointer to FILE type. The pointer to FILE type will hold a logical reference to our physically existed file on disk (hard disk).

In this post I will only explain how to create a file and write data into file. Step by step descriptive logic to create a file and write data into file.
